oh hey there! 

It's me Klea. I am currently studying International Management in Germany. 

I am passionate about Business Development, Start ups, Graphic Design, Marketing, Web Design and Web Development. 



I registered for this course, because I really want to learn how to build my own website from scratch. I have used so far wix.com, it has really helped me, but I would like to learn how to code it myself.
